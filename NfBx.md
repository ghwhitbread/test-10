# Names for Biodiversity Workshop

## Introduction
 Recent work on names is fragmented into individual and isolated project efforts. There are now more terms than concepts, more definitions than terms. Many, more-or-less, similar vocabularies, alternative frameworks and non-interoperable, application systems.

 This may well be the natural process of evolution but we do need to make time now to discuss synthesis and a more collaborative approach to development of a workable standard for names. Can we work together to fill the gaps, and to resolve the competing requirements of aggregation and science, data and knowledge, product and research, Code-compliance and interoperability.

## Purpose
 To raise awareness of the importance of names to biodiversity informatics and to re-invigorate a more collaborative phase of standards development with names within the TDWG umbrella.

 This workshop will aim for consensus around the idea that we can work together within TDWG to evolve a pragmatic replacement for the existing names standards, and a map to get us there.

## Goals

1. Reconvene the [Taxonomic Names and Concepts Interest Group](https://www.tdwg.org/community/tnc/)
	* Membership
	* GitHub, [tdwg/tnc](https://github.com/tdwg/tnc)
	* Standards maintenance.
2. Agreement on a plan for a replacement of the **Taxonomic Concept Transfer Schema (TCS)** that:
	* is compliant with the TDWG [Standards Documentation Standard](https://github.com/tdwg/vocab/tree/master/sds) and [Vocabulary Maintenance Standard](https://github.com/tdwg/vocab/tree/master/vms).
	* provides for the needs of the various types of users and use cases of Taxonomic Names in the biodiversity informatics space
	* as much as possible synthesises and takes benefit of the work that has been done in the TDWG community so far.

## Uses / Stakeholders

- Simple checklists, aggregators: GBIF, ALA, CoL; agitators: @rdmpage
- Species Information Systems
- Floras, Faunas etc.
- Systems that capture historical (as well as current) name usages: NSL, APNI, AFD
- Systems that try to capture phylogenetic relationships

## Current standards

-  [**Taxonomic Concept Transfer Schema (TCS)**](https://www.tdwg.org/standards/tcs/)

    	  *TCS 1.01 Schema Documentation* can be found at http://tdwg.github.io/tcs/schema/1.01

-   [**Darwin Core**](https://www.tdwg.org/standards/dwc/)

    	  *Darwin Core* terms can be found at http://tdwg.github.io/dwc/terms/

## Issues

 Expectation reversal, but

  - Taxa **change**
     - AFD = taxonomic (opinion) product, not a Nomenclator, not a taxon store.
		- @rdmpage:  WTAF
  - Taxonomic Names are **stable.**
  - Inappropriate use of taxon.

 No "Names" standard.

  - Darwin Core RDF Guide recommends separate vocabulary.
   - Ad hoc Darwin Core extensions.
   - Inappropriate use of the taxonomic concept

 TCS

   - XML too esoteric:
     - Okay at the enterprise level
	- Not being used, or ...
	- used anyway.
   - Application schema
     - Interchange of literature based concept definitions
   - Difficult to distill, harder to extend.
   - Syntax (XML) → path to RDF … JSON.
   - Over engineered for normal usage:)
   - Relationship object
	   -  Path to RDF, JSON-LD

    			    How does tcs:TaxonConcept relate to dwc:Taxon?

    			    How does tcs:TaxonConcept relate to NameUsage and nsl:Instance?

Darwin Core ambiguous
  - Overloaded definitions
    - Many interpretations.
  - Overloaded usage.
  - Classification terms.
  - Ranks.
  - Path to RDF …

Many different application profiles 
  - Simple vocabulary required.

A Domain Model?
  - Agreement on definitions
  - Classes
  - Code compliance

## Strategy / Way Forward?
   
A new standard or update/replace/extend existing standards?

Restart with ideas in **Linnean Core** (J.Cooper)
- A Basic vocabulary for the interchange and use of Taxonomic Names and "names".
- Darwin Core  extensions    NFB  < TCS.
- Controlled vocabularies!
- Recommend classes.
- Guidelines.

**Darwin Core**
- leave "convenience" terms and internal links.
- remove external links (id terms) ?
- Add new terms?
- [Darwin Core RDF Guide](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/guides/rdf/index.htm#2.6_Darwin_Core_ID_terms_and_RDF)

**A Domain Model or List?**
- Normative or Guide?
- API specification for:
	- Name
	- Instance (name occurrence) according 
	- Usage ( potential/taxonomic concept)
	- Taxon
	- Taxonomic Tree ?
	- Arrangement

## What are we looking for in a Name standard/vocabulary?
   
- (Core competencies / Functional Requirements / Use cases)
- Generic metadata model
	- Vocabularies
- Full Code support
	- ICN, ICZN, ...
	- Code maintenance
		- Domain owners?
- Interoperability
  - Every name
  - Every instance (name usage)
  - Every relationship
  - Every point of view
  - Every version
  - Every syntax
  - Every application profile
  - Common interchange format
  - Support for publication
  - Extensible
- Obey the the TDWG laws for standards and vocabularies
- Independent of serialization
- Concise vocabulary
- RDF support
  - Application Profiles
  -  Simple enough for …. Anything

## Terminology 

  **Some core concepts**

   A **name** is a "name", a designation, a label, a string used as a name: in any context.

   A **taxonomic name** is a *name* used in a taxonomic context; often a scientific name formulated (or attempted to be) according to some rules of nomenclature.

   A **reference** is a citable work: a publication, a resource, ...

   A **taxonomic name instance** is the occurrence of a name in a *reference*. A fact.  One **usage** of a *taxonomic name* establishing context: establishment of a name, a concept, a synonym, an assertion, a relationship; tax. nov., comb.nov., … , a misapplication, or assertion; a common name.

   A **taxonomic concept** is a *taxonomic name instance* establishing or circumscribing a taxonomic entity - often linking synonymic inclusions and adding annotations, description…

   A **taxonomic tree** is a hierarchical arrangement of *taxonomic concepts*

   A **taxon** is a reusable branch or leaf of a *taxonomic tree*.

## NSL Example [todo]

   Bibliographic pattern:  Where a name is found and how it is used in that place.

   - Every taxonomic name instance.
    -Just about names and taxa:
        - Authors, References detail elsewhere -  external resources
